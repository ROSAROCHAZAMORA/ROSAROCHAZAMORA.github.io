Hi all! My name Rosa, and I am a chemistry undergraduate student at CalPoly SLO. A bit about me is that I come from a farmworker family, and I have also worked in the fields with my parents picking raspberries and blackberries.  Working alongside my parents, I learned there are no days off, there is no time for rest, and there is always something more to get done every day. Combining my agricultural background and traditional upbringing motivates me to pursue a career beyond what is expected of me. My passion for chemistry bloomed when I took my first organic chemistry (ochem) class. I was amazed by the fact that it was just drawing structures and not letters. After my ochem class, I could not stay away from chemistry. Besides my background and passion for chemistry, I enjoy riding my road bicycle, hiking, and gardening.
